# rock_paper_scissors

This is a basic rock paper scissors game. It is intended for friends and family and anyone who id a fan of the game! It is built using HTMl, CSS and JavaScript. It is ment to showcase how JavaScript works and how it makes it possible to build interactive websites using JavaScript. Hopefully it does this in an enjoyable way via playing the famous rock paper scissors.

# Existing Features

At the top of the page we have the heading of the game making it clear to the user what game they are about to play.

The game area is easily understandable as there are three clickable images of either rock paper or scissors and the user can select their choice via clicking on either of the three images.

# Score board

The score board clearly shows in two columns the score for each player. the player score and the commputer scorre. NB. I am still in the process of implementing the score increment and displaying to the screen.

# Unfixed Bugs

There are quite a few bugs in the application that need addressing as mentioned earlier in the Score board section the score is not displaying on screen or incrementing. The same issue exists for the player choice is not displaying on screen. and also the winner cannot be determined yet as that feature has not yet been implemented. The reason for these bugs is due to time limitations.

However I will have all these features and bugs sorted hopefully in a future update of the application.
