# rock_paper_scissors

This is a basic rock paper scissors game. It is intended for friends and family and anyone who id a fan of the game! It is built using HTMl, CSS and JavaScript. It is ment to showcase how JavaScript works and how it makes it possible to build interactive websites using JavaScript. Hopefully it does this in an enjoyable way via playing the famous rock paper scissors.

# Existing Features

At the top of the page we have the heading of the game making it clear to the user what game they are about to play.

The game area is easily understandable as there are three clickable images of either rock paper or scissors and the user can select their choice via clicking on either of the three images.

# Score board

The score board clearly shows in two columns the score for each player. the player score and the commputer scorre. NB. I am still in the process of implementing the score increment and displaying to the screen.

# Unfixed Bugs

There are quite a few bugs in the application that need addressing as mentioned earlier in the Score board section the score is not displaying on screen or incrementing. The same issue exists for the player choice is not displaying on screen. and also the winner cannot be determined yet as that feature has not yet been implemented. The reason for these bugs is due to time limitations.

However I will have all these features and bugs sorted hopefully in a future update of the application.

# Deployment of the application

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 

The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits and Media

The photos and images used in the application to represent rock paper and scissors were all taken from pexels.com and I used the book Eloquent JavaScrit 3rd Edition to understand event listeners and arrow functions.
